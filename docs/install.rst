Installation
============

mamba
-----

We recommend using `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html#mamba-installation>`_ which is a drop-in replacement for ``conda`` and is much faster.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mamba create --name espaloma -c conda-forge "espaloma=0.3.2"
